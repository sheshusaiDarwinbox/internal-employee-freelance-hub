# Comprehensive Plan for Chat Functionality

## Plan:

1. **Update `ChatPage.jsx`**:
   - Remove the local socket state and instead use the socket instance from the Redux store.
   - Modify the `handleSendMessage` function to emit messages through the Redux-managed socket.

2. **Refactor `WebSocketConnection.jsx`**:
   - Remove the duplicate definition of the `handleSendMessage` function to avoid confusion.
   - Ensure that the socket connection is properly established and managed.

3. **Review `chat.controller.ts`**:
   - Ensure that the `sendMessage` function correctly emits messages to the intended recipient using the socket instance.

4. **Verify `socket.ts`**:
   - Confirm that the socket events are correctly handled and that the message structure aligns with what the frontend sends.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Test the chat functionality to ensure that messages are sent and received correctly between users.
- Verify that the chat history retrieval works as expected.
